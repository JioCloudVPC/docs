# EC2 API testing:
  1. Create PAAS account:
     - There should be an entry ec2db when created with proper arguments
     - Should throw error if account is present

  2. Delete Pass:
     - Remove entry from ec2db
     - Should throw an error if PAAS accout has any active PNIs


# Neutron Testing:
  1. Create Port:
     - Should allow cross account port creation.i.e. if network id is in different network and request is from PAAS network
     - Entry for new PNI should be made in ec2db
     - Should rollback if ec2 db is inaccessible
     - IP should be from network of the tenant
     - IN IFMAP view it should come under tenant's network
     - Disallow cross port creation if request is not from PAAS network

  2. List port:
     If queried from PAAS account:
       - PNI's created should be visible when List port is done.
       - Result should be accurate if any filter is given
       - Listing of individual PAAS port should be permitted.

     If queried from customers account:
       - Should be able to list only pni's of own acount created by single/multiple PAAS account aling with other ports in the network
       - Quering individual port should be permitted

  3. Update port:
     If queried from PAAS account:
       - Updating cross account port(pni) properties should be permitted.
       - A port creted by a PAAS account could not be updated by other PAAS account

     If queried from customers account:
       - Should be refrained from updating any port apart from its own.

  4. Delete Port:
     - Should allow cross account port deletion.i.e. if port is created by same PAAS account
     - Entry for deleted PNI should be removed in ec2db
     - Should rollback if ec2 db is inaccessible
     - Disallow cross port deletion if request is not from PAAS network

  . Misc:
     - Should not allow any other resources creation/deletion/updation/List apart from port.
